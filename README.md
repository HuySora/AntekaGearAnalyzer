# AntekaGearAnalyzer
A kinda slow but fast enough gear analyzer for EpicSeven

I've only ever tested it on Bluestacks.

<h3>How to Use</h3>
Click on the "Select" button, then click on the titlebar of Bluestacks.

You should see the name of your Bluestacks instance in the text box next to the "Select" button.

Go to the enhance page of any piece of gear and click the big "Check" button.
